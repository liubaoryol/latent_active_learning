# Active Imitation Learning

### Tasks and goal

1. Compare how active imitation learning works on partially observable MDPs
    a. Develop a challenging toy environment where latent states are critical for behavior
    b. Train and test AIRL, OptionGAIL, HierAIRL on these environments. *side note: is LatentAIRL better or worse and why?*
    c. Train and test same algorithms, but in DaGGER style.
    d. Nice graphs to analyze final results as well as training results.

### Vinson
1. Help me add metrics during training. Tensorboard?
2. Repeat experiments 5-10 times?
3.
